    For two centuries following the arrival of settlers from England and the Netherlands, 
    the area where the village of Woodside would be established was sparsely populated. 
    The land was fertile, but also wet. Its Native American inhabitants called it a place of 
    "bad waters" and it was known to early European settlers as a place of "marshes, muddy flats and bogs," 
    where "wooded swamps" and "flaggy pools" were fed by flowing springs."[10][11] Until drained in the 
    nineteenth century, one of these wet woodlands was called Wolf Swamp after the predators that infested it.

    Everyone knows about Belgian chocolate and probably the famous gueuze lambic beer, 
    but there are many more lesser known regional specialities that are well worth trying. 
    Museum of Cacao and Chocolate close to Grand-Place is a good place to go to. There are over a hundred museums in Brussels.
